NewsPaperly is designed for blogs, magazines, newspapers, and writers in general. The theme works with most schema markups (json etc) so you can have reviews or other types of affiliate content. We have optimized the SEO (search engine optimization) a lot so it's easy to find websites that use our blogging theme on Google and other search engines (even ASK). We have made sure to put lots of space for ads, you can have them in the top, sidebar, footer, and more, all through widgets so it's easy to integrate ad programs such as AdSense. It's of course responsive and has a simple, elegant, and modern design. You can publish editorial content about fashion, travel, lifestyle, technology, or even revenue generating content such as cryptocurrency, forex, betting, gambling, and more. Starting a news magazine has never been this easy. Start your journal today!
